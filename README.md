INTRODUCTION:

The Task Manager is a Java console application that uses a Max-Heap to manage tasks based on priority. Tasks are added, viewed, and removed according to their priority levels.

What It Can Do:

Add Task: Add a task with a description and priority.
View Tasks: Display tasks in order of priority (highest first).
Remove Task: Remove the highest-priority task.
Exit: Close the application.

Why I Made This Application:

I made this application to demonstrate how a heap can be used for task scheduling and priority management, providing practical experience with heap data structures.

How It Contributes to Me and the Community:

For me, it deepens my understanding of heaps and their applications. For the community, it offers a simple example of using a heap in Java, which can be a useful learning tool and a foundation for more complex systems.
